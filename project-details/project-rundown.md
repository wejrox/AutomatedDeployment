# Automated Deployment
A series of Ansible playbooks, scripts, and orchestration definitions used in the deployment of my personal projects.

## Reason for creation
In order to seamlessly deploy my projects through a standard method, I wished to use automation and isolation to create an environment that could be replicated simply and effectively even when a host machine hadn't been previously initialised.

## Tech used
- Ansible.
- Docker.
- Docker swarm mode.
- Bash.
- Visual Studio Code.

## Definition of done
This project will be defined as completed when it:
- [ ] Contains Ansible roles and playbooks for deploying my repositories.
- [ ] Contains the dockerfiles for the building of my repository microservices.
- [ ] Contains the docker-compose stack definitions for my microsevices.
- [ ] Contains the environment-specific source files for my microservices.
- [ ] Contains brief documentation with examples of how to execute the deployment.

## Retrospective
This repository is still under development, so no retrospective is available.
